This is a simple wrapper around the [Coinroll](https://coinroll.it) API.
Well, coinroll.py is. The other files are examples of how you can use it.

There's a few strategy scripts. I'm too lazy to describe each of them. One is
martingale strategy, one is fibonacci system, and one is cancellation system.
You can look up how they work online or read my code.

history.py will fetch your entire bet history and present it similar to how
the strategy scripts present bet results.

plot.py will write your bet history to a file that can be parsed by gnuplot,
so you can get a pretty graph of your bet history.

You can run the scripts without any arguments for a usage message.
